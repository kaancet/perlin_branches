A small ensemble of sketches to test perlin noise generation(used code from [here](https://github.com/Supreme-Sector/Python-Perlin-Noise)), and py5 processing.

The branches are made by creating a stem with perlin noise and then randomly generating length of outward growing leaves. 
Also selects two random colors and creates a gradient between them to color the leaves.

Yes, I like randomness...
